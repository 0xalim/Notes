# Thread Intelligence

Research:
1. Get threat actors via databases, orgs
1. Get threats from other hackers
 1. Or the internet
1. Staying up to dates with latest threats

OSINT - Open-source intelligence:
1. Open source, public information
1. From:
 1. Internet, forums or social media, posts
 1. Government data, public hearings, reports
 1. Commercial data, financial reports, databases

Closed/proprietary intelligence:
1. Can buy premade databases with threat information
1. Threat intelligence services
 1. They compile threat data and present to buyers
 1. To protect their org
1. Constant threat monitoring:
 1. Provide services to find new threats in your system
 1. All automatic

Vulnerability databases:
1. Researchers/testers find vulnerabilities and dump to database
1. CVE - Common vulnerabilities and exposures:
 1. Community managed database of vulnerabilities
 1. Sponsored by DHS (Dep. of homeland sec) and CISA (Csec. and infra. security
    agency)
1. NVD - National vulnerability database:
 1. Summary of cve's
 1. Sponsored by same guys
 1. Provide severity scoring
 1. Provide ideas to patch

Public/private information-sharing centers:
1. Public threat intelligence:
 1. Classified information but made available
 1. Databases online
1. Private threat intelligence:
 1. Made and given by private security companies
1. Receiving information:
 1. Need latest information and good quality information
1. CTA - Cyber threat alliance:
 1. Member created org
 1. People find and report on threat intelligence
 1. Share with other members, these guys validate the information

Automated indicator sharing (AIS):
1. Industry standard way to share important threat data
1. Standardized format: STIX - Structured threat information expression:
 1. Describe cyber threat information
 1. Include motivation, abilities, capabilities, response information
 1. TAXII - Trusted automated exchange of indicator information, method of
    sharing STIX across orgs

Dark web intelligence:
1. Dark web:
 1. Overlay network that uses the internet
 1. Requires tor to access + other configuration
1. Hacker groups and services:
 1. Activities, tools and techniques, credit card sales, acc cred
1. Many forums to use for research

Indicators of compromise (IOC):
1. Event that indicates intrusion
1. Indicators:
 1. Unusual amount of traffic
 1. Unusual direction of traffic
 1. Different file checksums/hash files
 1. International traffic
 1. Changes to DNS data
 1. Uncommon login patterns
 1. Many read requests to specific files

Predictive analysis:
1. Analyze large amounts of data very quickly
 1. Suspicious patterns
1. Identify behavior: DNS query, traffic pattern, location data
1. Forecast for potential attacks, early warning system
1. Combined with machine learning

Threat maps:
1. Identify worldview of attacks and trends

File/code repos:
1. See what tools hackers are making
1. Public code repos
1. Github
1. People accidentally push private data publically
1. Attackers look for code to exploit:
 1. Accidental public code released, easy to analyze for vulnerabilities
 1. Content for phishing attacks
