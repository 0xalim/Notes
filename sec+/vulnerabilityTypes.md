# Vulnerability Types

0-day:
1. New vulners
1. Researchers trying to find these
1. Attackers can find these first themselves
 1. Can sell vulnerabilities
1. 0-day is never seen before attack, no patch

Open permissions:
1. No security on information put on internet
1. Cloud storage -> misconfigurations leaves lots of data open
 1. Verizon records exposed for example

Unsecured root accounts:
1. Misconfiguration, easy to guess password or bruteforce
1. Should disable direct login to root account
1. Protect accounts with root/admin access

Errors:
1. Error msgs leaving too much information out
1. Service #, version info and debug information

Weak encryption:
1. Many encryption protocols (AES, 3DES)
1. Longer encryption key is better
1. Hash for integrity (SHA, MD5)
1. Wireless encryption
1. Stay up to date with latest best practice
1. TLS is a common issue
 1. Use good cipher suites
1. Keys of 128 or less are easy to bruteforce
1. Don't use md5, or outdated trash

Insecure protocols:
1. Use secure version of protocols
 1. FTP, SMTP, IMAP all clear traffic
1. Verify traffic in protocol, not cleartext

Default settings:
1. IoT devices and more have default creds
 1. Users usually never change these
1. Mirai botnet
 1. Uses IoT default config
 1. Cams, routers and more
 1. Mirai released as open-source

Open ports + services:
1. More ports open, more insecurity
1. Firewalls manage ports
 1. Ingress/egress traffic
 1. Allow/deny based on port and ip address or direction of traffic
 1. Rules can be complex, easy to misconfigure
 1. Test and audit!

Improper patch management:
1. Centrally managed by vendor:
 1. Test and then deploy
 1. Make sure its secure
1. Firmware, bios of device
1. Os patches
1. Application patches

Legacy platforms:
1. Old devices, older os, middleware installed
1. End-of-life software or even longer!
 1. Security concern
1. Security protections around the machine if necessary to keep
 1. Not best option
 1. Only when really needed
