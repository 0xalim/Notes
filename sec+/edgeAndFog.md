# Edge and Fog

Cloud computing:
1. Computing on-demand + massive data storage capacity
1. Fast implementation:
 1. Rapid change for IT teams
 1. Smaller costs, pay-as-you-go
1. Drawback:
 1. Latency - too far apart
 1. Limited bandwidth
 1. Difficult to protect data, thirdparty in charge
 1. Requires internet network

Edge computing:
1. IoT devices, very specific functionality devices
 1. Lighting, temp, etc
1. Edge computing - edge:
 1. All processing happens on local device, not over network
1. No latency, no network required, better speed performance

Fog computing:
1. Fog:
 1. Cloud thats close to your data
 1. Cloud+IoT
1. Fog computing:
 1. Distributed cloud architecture
 1. Can send data to cloud, but not necessarily all in 1 place
1. Data and processing:
 1. Processing can happen on device, data can be pushed to cloud if needed
 1. Private data, minimal security concern
 1. Internet only when required
