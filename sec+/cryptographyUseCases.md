# Cryptography Use Case

Balance:
1. Low power devices:
 1. Limited storage, battery, cpu
 1. Uses ECC for asymmetric encryption
1. Low latency:
 1. Fast computation time
 1. Symmetric uses smaller keys
1. High resiliency:
 1. Larger key sizes
 1. Hashing provides integrity

## Use cases

Confidentiality:
 1. Secrecy and privacy
Integrity:
 1. Prevent modification
 1. File download + password storage
Obfuscation:
 1. Malware uses this to bypass antivirus products
Authentication:
 1. Hash + salt password
Non-repudiation:
 1. Confirm authenticity of data
 1. Digital signature provides integrity and non-repudiation
