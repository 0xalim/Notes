# Power Redundancy

## UPS

Uninterruptible Power Supply:
1. If one power source is gone, use another (temporary)
1. During blackouts
1. UPS types:
 1. Offline: on standby mode until needed
 1. Line-interactive: If power is dynamically being lost, add as needed
 1. On-line: Always providing power
1. Features:
 1. Auto-shutdown
 1. Different battery capacity

## Generators

Long term power backup (Needs fuel)
1. Can power entire building
1. 10-15 second waiting period
1. Can combine ups+generator to remove this period

## Dual power supply

1. Redundancy: Multiple power supply into machines
1. Each power supply can supply 100% of load if needed
 1. Normally runs at 50%
1. Hot-swappable: One line fails, can replace plug as needed

## Power distribution unit (PDU)

1. Multiple power outputs
1. Possible to have monitoring
