# Cloud-based Vs. On-Premise Attacks

Attacks can happen anywhere:
1. Cloud-based data
1. On-premise data

Cloud based is centralized, costs less:
1. No dedicated hardware
1. No data centre
1. Thirty party handles everything

On premise puts security burden on client:
1. Data center security and infrastructure costs
1. Can customize your entire security posture
 1. Full control of everything
1. On site IT team can manage the security better
 1. Additional cost overhead for security team
1. Local team maintains uptime and availability
 1. System checks occur at any time
1. Security changes can take time
 1. New equipment
 1. Configurations
 1. More costs

Cloud based:
1. Data is in secure environment
1. No physical access to data center
 1. Third party may have access to data
1. Cloud providers manage large-scale security
 1. Automated signature and security updates
 1. Users must follow best practices
1. Limited downtime, more availability
1. Scalable security options
 1. No as customizable as on-site
 1. One-click security deployments
