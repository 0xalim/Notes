# Wireless Jamming

Radio frequency (RF) jamming:
1. DoS
1. Decrease signal-to-noise ratio at access point/station
 1. Good signal vs. useless noise
 1. Higher noise, then receiving end cannot hear good
1. Not always intentional:
 1. Microwave oven, flourescent lights
1. Can be intentional for DoS

Wireless Jamming:
1. Via:
 1. Useless information
 1. Random bits over legitimate frames
1. Reactive jamming:
 1. Only jam when someone is trying to communicate
1. Need to be somewhere close
1. Fox hunt, need proper equipment:
 1. Directional antenna, attenuator
 1. Way to find jamming device/attacker
