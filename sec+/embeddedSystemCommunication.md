# Embedded Systems Communication

## 5G

High speed comms over wireless:
1. Significant IoT impact
1. Large data transfer
1. Better cloud processing

## Subscriber identity module (SIM)

SIM card:
1. Any communication requires SIM card
1. Provides information to cellular network provider
1. Contains mobile details
1. Important to manage, many devices many sims

## Narrowband

1. Narrow freqency range
1. Longer distance travel
1. SCADA equipment
1. Sensors in fields

## Baseband

1. 1 frequency to communicate
1. Fiber/wire
1. All communication takes up 100% of usage
1. Bidirectional: not at same time though
1. Ethernet standard

## Zigbee

IEE standard 802.15.4:
1. Differnet than wifi and bluetook
1. Longer distance
1. Less power consumption
1. Mesh network:
 1. IoT can hop over other IoTs to communicate
1. ISM band:
 1. Industrial, scientific and medical band
