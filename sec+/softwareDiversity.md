# Software Diversity

Exploiting apps:
1. Finding 1 vulnerability makes everyone using that system/service vulnerable
1. Different binary of executables and os?

Software diversity:
1. Everytime compiled, different binary file
 1. Same functionality
1. Exploit that works on 1 machine wont on another
1. More work required
