# Quantum Computing

1. Computers based on quantum physics
1. New computer technology
1. Quantum mechanics:
 1. Qubit instead of bits
 1. Qubits are somewhere in middle of 1 and 0, both at the same time

## Post quantum crypto

1. Breaks all prime number calculation based cryptography
1. Significant issue, no crypto would be trusted
1. Shor's algorithm: theoretically faster way of finding prime factors
1. NTRU new encryption with quantum computing via 'closest-vector' problem

## Quantum communication

1. Protect eavesdropping using quantum crypto:
 1. Quantum key distribution
 1. Unbreakable encryption
 1. Both sides can verify, should be same if no eavesdroppers
 1. If eavesdropped then both keys would not be the same
