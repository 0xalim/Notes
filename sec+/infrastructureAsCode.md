# Infrastructure as Code

Deployments:
1. Deploying services automatically without personnel
1. Define server, network and application as code
1. Use code to build and deploy application instances
 1. Can be used anywhere at any time
 1. Perfect version everytime

SDN - Software Defined Networking:
1. Networking devices have 2 operations now:
 1. Control plane: management of device, like iptables
 1. Data plane: operation of device, router forwarding
1. Direct programming, configure without breaking operation
1. Agile, changes can be made without reboot
1. Central manage, 1 console for all sdn devices
1. Automated, no human intervention
1. Open standards, standard interface - vendor neutral

SDN security:
1. Deploy sdn firewalls connecting to all devices
1. Deploy sdn firewall/ips between load balancer and internet

Software defined visibility - SDV:
1. Need to see traffic to secure data
1. Dynamic deployment for security+network visibility devices:
 1. firewall
 1. webapp firewall
 1. siem
1. VXLAN, virtual extensible lan:
 1. Encapsulation used in cloud based technology and TLS
