# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability Scans:
1. Minimal invasive, not penetration test
1. Port scanning
1. System scanning, IoT, security devices
1. Test external and internal
1. Gathering as much info as possible

Scan types:
1. Non-intrusive scans:
 1. Just gathering information, not exploiting anything
1. Intrusive scans:
 1. See if the exploit works
1. Non-credentialed scans:
 1. No creds to log onto device
1. Credentialed scans:
 1. Simulate insider attack

Identify vulnerabilities:
1. Scanner only has signatures, known vulnerabilities
1. Application scans: desktop apps + mobile apps
1. Web application scans: php vulnerabilities
1. Network scans: firewalls, ports, iot devices

Vulnerability research:
1. Vulners, CVE's can be found online
 1. National vulnerability db NVD
 1. Mitre CVE
 1. Go to vendor, microsoft
1. Some vulnerabilities cannot be found/no cve
1. NVD:
 1. Common vulnerability scoring system, 0-10
 1. Can automate feed

Vulnerability scan log review:
1. Lack of security controls:
 1. No firewall
 1. No antivirus/spyware
1. Misconfiguration:
 1. Open shares
 1. Guest access
1. Real vulnerability

False positives:
1. Vulnerability identified is false
1. Maybe lower severity level
1. False negatives:
 1. Vulnerability missed
 1. Need updated signatures

Configuration review:
1. Workstations:
 1. Account config
 1. Local device settings
1. Servers:
 1. Access control
 1. Permission settings
1. Security devices:
 1. Firewall rules
 1. Authentication options
