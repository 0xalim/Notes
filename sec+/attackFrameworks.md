# Attack Frameworks

## Attack and response

1. Many attacks come out on a daily basis
1. Response and intel team needs assistance
1. Need to understand attacks & vectors
1. Assess risk in organization

## MITRE ATT&CK framework

1. Based on mitre corp
1. https://attack.mitre.org
1. Supports us government agencies
1. Determine the actions of an attack:
 1. Identify intrusion point
 1. Methods used to escalate and move
 1. Potential security techniques to block in future attacks

## Diamond model of intrusion analysis

1. Designed by intelligence community
1. Scientific principles to intrusion analysis:
 1. Measurement, testability, repeatability
1. Adversary, capability, victim, infrastructure 4 corners:
 1. Develops, Exploits, Connects to, Uses
 1. Relationship between each corner

## Cyber kill chain

1. Seven phases of cyber attack
1. Military concept
1. Phases:
 1. Recon: gather intel, harvest emails from google and more
 1. Weaponization: build deliverable payload that includes exploit + backdoor
 1. Delivery: send the weapon and deliver executable
 1. Exploit: execute code on victim device
 1. Installation: malware is installed into the operating system
 1. Command & control: C2 channel for remote access
 1. Actions on objectives: Attackers care out remote objectives
