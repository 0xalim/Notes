# Secure Areas

1. No physical access to internal systems
1. Prevent people physically accessing machines internally
1. Securing backups is necessary too

## Air gap

1. Physical separation between networks
1. Seperate infrastructures if needed
1. Environments are shared in some networks:
 1. Shared router, switch, firewall
 1. VM is used as well
1. Specialized environments need air gaps:
 1. Power systems / SCADA
 1. Airplanes
 1. Nuclear power plants

## Vaults and Safes

Vault:
1. Secure reinforced rooms
1. Store backups
1. Prevent theft
1. Often onsite

Safe:
1. Smaller than vault
1. Less expensive
1. Space is limited
1. Can install at many locations (not centralized)

## Hot and cold aisles

Data centers:
1. Machines produce heat
1. Lots of machines in small area
1. Need optimized cooling
1. Conserve energy by only cooling required places, not entire room
1. Lower energy cost
1. Hot and cold aisle reuse temp to reduce energy cost
