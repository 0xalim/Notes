# SIEM Dashboards

## SIEM

1. Security information and event management
1. Central hub for all logs
1. Security alert + real time info
1. Long term storage & log aggregation
1. Can correlate big data
1. Good for forensic analysis

## Getting data

1. From sensors and logs:
 1. Os, network devices, netflow sensors (3rd party sensors)
1. Sensitivity settings:
 1. Easy to be overwhelmed with data
 1. Some info is unnecessary
 1. Informational, warning, urgent or another categorization method

## Viewing the data

1. Trends: attacks change over time
1. Alerts: identify security event and raw data
1. Correlation: Correlate data to patch holes in network
