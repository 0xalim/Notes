# Wireless Disassociation Attacks

Wireless Deauthentication/Disassociation:
1. Wireless connecting disconnecting and coming back on multiple times
1. Nothing you can do
 1. Need ethernet
1. Wireless deauthentication:
 1. DoS attack wirelessly
1. 802.11 Management frames:
 1. Frames that make wireless communication work
 1. Wireless device+access point method of communication
 1. Manage QoS, associate/disassociate with access point
1. 802.11 No security standards:
 1. Sent clear over network
 1. No authentication/validation

Protecting against deauth attacks:
1. Problem addressed: 802.11w in 2014
 1. Traffic is encrypted
1. Third traffic cannot send frames as you
1. Not everything is encrypted
 1. Beacons, probs, authentication, association
1. 802.11w required for 802.11ac compliance
 1. Anything above 802.11ac good to go
