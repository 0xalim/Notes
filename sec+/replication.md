# Replication

## SANS replication

Storage Area Network (SANs)
1. Specialized high performance network for storage devices
1. Multiple frontend for accessing data in centralized spot
1. Can replicate data between SANs
1. Multiple data centers with SANs and can switch between
1. Can snapshot SANs to copy entire machine

## VM replication

VM machine redundancy:
1. Maintain one vm, replicate to all others
1. Consistancy maintained
1. This 1 vm is backup if needed
1. Efficient copying: dont need to replicate if 1 file is changed

## On premises vs. Cloud redundancy

1. Speed:
 1. Local faster
 1. Cloud slower speed
1. Money:
 1. High cost for local
 1. Cloud is low cost + scalable
1. Security:
 1. Local data is private
 1. Cloud requires more security control (encryption + more)
