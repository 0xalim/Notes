# Threat research

Research:
1. Know the enemies out there, and the tools they use
1. Constantly changing field
1. Information from many different places, not relying on 1 source

Vendor websites:
1. Vendors write software, they know the most
1. They know when problems are announced
1. These vendors patch vulnerabilities for their own software
 1. Zero-days
 1. Support options

Vulnerability feeds:
1. NVD - national vulnerability database
1. CVE data feeds - mitre
1. Third party feeds for more coverage
1. Management system to have data centralized for specific needs
 1. Easy to find vulners for specific org
 1. Know asap when vulnerability is disclosed

Conferences:
1. Latest vulnerabilities
1. Researches:
 1. New attack technology and methods
 1. Good for intelligence gathering
1. Other people:
 1. Other peoples stories about them working in this environment
 1. New methods to protect your data
 1. Good strategy
 1. Build relationships and form alliances

Academic journals:
1. Cutting edge security analysis
1. Research from academic professionals about current technology
 1. And latest attack methods
1. Detailed papers:
 1. Deep dive into malware
 1. Breaks apart into very specific information

Request for comments (RFC):
1. Published by internet society (ISOC):
 1. Written by internet engineering task force (IETF)
1. Specific standards, and lesser known ones like:
 1. Experimental
 1. Best practices
 1. Standard track
 1. Historic
1. RFC's contain detailed threat analyzations

Industry groups:
1. Local peers share industry and technology information
1. Associations:
 1. Differnet local associations
 1. Meet in many different areas and discuss local challenges
1. Industry user groups:
 1. Cisco, microsoft and vmware + more
 1. Security oriented technologies

Social media:
1. Hacker group conversations
1. Honeypot monitoring
 1. Identify new exploits
1. Keywords:
 1. CVE-202X, bugbounty, 0-day
1. Professionals discussing vulnerabilities in detail
1. C&C over twitter

Threat feeds:
1. Monitor announcement
1. Sources of information:
 1. DHS
 1. FBI
 1. SANS internet storm center
 1. Many more

TTP:
1. Tactic, technique and procedure
 1. Look at how hackers do what they do, and what they do specifically
1. Better you know attackers ttp, easier to detect on system
1. Different ttps:
 1. Different tactic used by attacker depending on industry
 1. Different infrastructure being targetted by attackers (dns)
 1. Outbreak of malware
