1. Many systems
1. Strategies change on blue/red team
1. Intelligence data is reactive
1. Goal: Speed up reaction time

Intelligence fusion:
1. Too much data to go through and analyze
1. Many types of data: firewall logs, ips logs, dns records
1. Many teams to sift through different data
1. Big data analytics:
 1. Fuse all data together
 1. Analyze on big scale

 1. Logs, sensors
 1. IPS, IDS
 1. Network information
1. External sources:
 1. Threat feeds
 1. Governmental alerts
 1. Social media, bulletins
1. Correlate big data:
 1. Mathematical approach
 1. Predictive analysis

Cybersecurity Maneuvers:
1. Move firewalls and os
1. Set firewall rules
1. Block certain ip addresses
1. Deleting malicious software
