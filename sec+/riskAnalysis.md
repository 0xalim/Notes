# Risk Analysis

## Evaluating Risk

1. Risk register:
 1. Identify risk of every step
 1. Make solutions to those risks
 1. Monitor the results
1. Risk matrix:
 1. Visually view risk matrix
 1. Based on color and quantitative values

## Audit risk model

1. Inherent: Impact + likelihood
 1. Risk exists in absence on controls
 1. Connecting network to internet with no firewall for e.g
1. Residual: Inherent + control effectiveness:
 1. Risk exists after controls are considered
 1. Firewall added and connected to internet, calculate residual risk
1. Risk appetite: amount of risk org willing to take

## Risk control assessment

1. Cybersecurity requirements:
 1. Find gap: formal audit of self-assessment
 1. Build and maintain security systems on these requirements
 1. Determine is existing controls are compliant or not

## Risk awareness

1. Constant change, new reisk everyday
1. Difficult to manage defense
1. Knowledge is key
1. Maintain awareness:
 1. Presentations, security conferences, programs, group discussions

## Regulations that affect risk posture

1. Regulations associated to cybersecurity:
 1. Protecting personal info
 1. Information of breaches
1. HIPAA:
 1. Privacy of patient records
 1. New storage requirements, network security and protect against threats
1. GDPR: EU protection

## Qualitative risk assessment

1. Ask for opinions on how risky something is
1. Display visually with traffic light grid or other methods
1. Calculate overall risk of something given criteria:
 1. Cost, time, impact, how likely it is to occur

## Quantitative risk assessment

1. Annualized rate of occurance:
 1. How likely for natural disaster for example
1. Single loss expectancy:
 1. How much if a single event occurs, stolen machine 
1. Annualized loss expectancy:
 1. ARO x SLE
 1. X machines stolen ...
1. Business impact can be more than monetary

## Disaster types

1. Environmental
1. Person-made:
 1. Human error, negligence or error
 1. Arson, crime, etc
1. Internal vs external:
