# Embedded Systems

Embedded systems:
1. Hardware+Software designed for specific function
1. Built with task in mind:
 1. Size / cost
1. Example:
 1. Traffic light controller
 1. Digital watch

## System on a chip

SoC:
1. Multi component running on 1 chip
1. Very small:
 1. Cache, flash memory, low power consumption
1. Low security:
 1. Difficult to upgrade hardware

## Field programmable gate array FPGA

1. Integrated circuit that can be programmed after manufacturing
1. Can reprogram when needed
1. Common in infrastructure:
 1. Router, firewall

## SCADA / ICS

Supervisory control and data acquisition systems / Industral control system:
1. Large industrial equipment
1. Manufacturing floor
1. Monitor everything in central console
1. Real time information, system control
1. Not connected to internet for security reasons

## IoT

1. Sensors: heating, cooling, lighting
1. Home automation devices
1. Wearable: monitors
1. Facility automation: temperature, air, lighting
1. Weak security!

## Specialized

1. Heart monitor, insulin pump
1. Runs old versions to make sure no bugs
1. Vehicle: Controls electronics of car
1. Aircraft: Networks+sensors, do not want DoS or outage
1. Smart meters: in electrical, water utility

## VOIP

Voice over ip:
1. Allows voice cmmunication
1. Each device is a computer

## HVAC

Heaving ventilation and air con:
1. Complex system
1. Integrated with fire system
1. Machines monitor and controls all decisions + computation
1. Not built with security in mind

## Drones

Flying vehicles:
1. Manual control or automated
1. Commerical + non-commercial use
1. Bad security so prone to danger around others

## Printers, scanner and fax

1. Images stored memory
1. Bad security ^ attackers can steal content
1. Logs are badly secured

## RTOS

Real time os:
1. Deterministic processing schedule
1. All planned/scheduled out
1. No interrupts from other processes
1. Industrial equipment, automobiles
1. Military environments
1. Non-trivial so security is really bad

## Surveillance systems

1. Video/audio surveillance
1. Need to secure system so others dont gain access to it
1. Prevent DoS
1. Physically difficult to replace cameras
