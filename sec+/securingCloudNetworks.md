# Securing Cloud Networks

## Cloud Networks

1. Connectivity within the cloud
1. Connectivity from outside the cloud
1. How users communicate to cloud: vpn, internet?
1. Cloud devices communication:
 1. East,west; north,south
 1. External flow?

## Virtual Networks

1. Cloud contains servers, db, and virtual devices
1. Virtual switches, virtual routers:
 1. Building network from cloud console
 1. Same config as physical device
1. On demand networks

## Public and Private Subnets

1. Private clouds:
 1. Internal IPs
 1. Need VPN for communication
1. Public cloud:
 1. External ip
 1. Connect from anywhere
1. Hybrid cloud:
 1. Combined

## Segmentation

1. Contains VPCs, containers, and microservices
1. Separation is security opportunity:
 1. Data and app seperate
 1. Security system between app components
1. Virtualized security technologies:
 1. WAF: web application firewall
 1. NGFW: next generation firewall
 1. IPS

## API Inspection and Integration

1. Microservice architecture is security concern
1. Microservice communication:
 1. Attempts to access critical data
 1. Geo origin
 1. Unusual api calls
1. API monitoring:
 1. Specific API queries
 1. Monitor incoming and outgoing data
