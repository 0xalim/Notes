# Machine Learning

Machine learning
1. Sift through data
 1. Find patterns
 1. Provide services/info based on patterns
1. Requires lots of training data
 1. Driving car requires a lot of road time
 1. Face recognition requires analyzing lots of faces
1. Use:
 1. Stop spam
 1. Recommend products in online shops
 1. Recommend videos/movies
 1. Prevent car accidents

Poisoning the data:
1. Confuse the AI using invalid data
 1. AI now behaves wrong

Evasion Attacks:
1. AI is only as good as the training
1. Attackers can find holes and limitations
1. When training ends attackers change their format so it doesn't get filtered
1. AI that uses private data can release the confidential information
 1. Data like social security numbers
 1. AI fooled into revealing those numbers

Securing the learning algorithm:
1. Check and verify the learning data
1. Constantly stay up to date with more and better data
1. Train AI with possible poisoning
