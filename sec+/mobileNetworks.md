# Mobile Networks

## Point to Point

1. 1-1 connection
1. Connections between buildings 
1. Wifi repeaters: Extend length of existing network

## Point to multipoint

1. Popular communication method
1. Does not have full connectivity between nodes

## Cellular network

1. For mobile devices
1. Antenna covers area with certain frequences
1. Bad security:
 1. Traffic monitoring
 1. Location tracking
 1. Can connect all over the world

## Wifi

1. Local network
1. Same security concerns as wifi devices
1. Need to encrypt all data
1. On-path attack (mitm) possible
1. Denial of service via messing with frequency

## Bluetooth

1. High speed over short distance
1. Tether small personal devices
1. Personal area network PAN

## RFID

1. Radio frequency identification
1. Access badges, doors, anything to be tracked and more
1. Radar technology:
 1. Radio energy transmitted to tag
 1. RF powers the tag, id is transmitted back
 1. Bidirectional communication

## NFC

1. Near field communication
1. Payment system stuff
1. Bootstrap wireless devices
1. Access token
1. Security concern:
 1. Remote capture, wireless network so easily mitm
 1. Frequency jamming = dos
 1. Replay -> mitm
 1. Loss of rfc device so security concern

## IR

1. Infrared
1. Smartphones, tablets and more
1. Control entertainment center
1. File transfer possible
1. Bad security

## USB

1. Universal serial bus
1. Physical connection between devices
1. Physical, so need to be inperson
1. Leaving device alone is unsecure

## GPS

1. Global positioning system
1. Precise navigation
1. Determines location based on timing differences
1. Map, direction
