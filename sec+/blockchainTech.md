## Blockchain process

1. Transaction first
1. Before verification of transaction:
 1. Copy of transaction sent to everyone in blockchain
 1. All devices check to verify it
1. Verified transaction added to block containing other transactions
1. Hashing function hashes every transaction in block, if any changes
   have been made it's easy to see.
1. Complete block copied to all devices maintaing ledger
1. Any device that modifies ledger will be seen easily due to modified hash
   then will be rejected.
