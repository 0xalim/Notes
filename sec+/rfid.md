# RFID and NFC Attacks

RFID (Radio-frequency identification):
1. Everywhere:
 1. Access badges
 1. Inventory
 1. Pet ID
 1. Anything to be tracked
1. Uses radar:
 1. Radio transmitted is source of energy, no battery
 1. ID transmitted back
 1. Bidirectional communication
 1. Some tags can be active/powered

RFID Attacks:
1. Data can be captured
 1. Replay attack
1. Spoof reader
 1. Write your own data to tag
1. DoS to jam using correct frequencies
1. Decrypt communication

NFC (Near field communication):
1. Two-way vs RFID 1 way
1. Payment systems (checkout device)
1. NFC helps bluetooth pairing
1. Can be used to authenticate

Security concern:
1. Data can be captured
 1. If not encrypted
 1. 10m for active device
1. DoS to jam using correct frequencies
1. Replay/relay attack using on-path attack
1. Stealing phone/device and authenticate from attacker
