# Physical Security Control

## Barricades/bollards

1. Prevents people access
1. Prevents cars area access
1. Funnel people to specific area
1. Identify safety concern areas

## Access control vestibules

Options:
1. Doors are unlocked until someone opens a door somewhere else
1. All doors locked, unlocking 1 prevents others from being unlocked
1. One open door, other is locked. Only 1 open at a time
1. Limits amount of people in security area

## Alarm

Circuit-based:
1. Window/door opened, circuit is broken then alarm goes off

Motion Detection:
1. Radio echo, passive infrared
1. Useful only in some areas

Duress:
1. Triggered by a person
1. Big red button

## Signs

Clear+specific instructions:
1. Keep people away from some areas
1. For guests who have only come for the first time

Personal safety:
1. Fire exits
1. Warning signs (chemical, fire, construction)
1. Medical resources
1. Contact details

## Video surveillance

CCTV (closed circuit television):
1. Replaces security guards
1. Features:
 1. Motion detection can trigger alarm
 1. Object detection (license, face detection) tracks people that enter
1. Networked together so all areas are covered

## Industrial camouflage

1. Conceal facility by blending into environment
1. No business signs, no visual stuff
1. Surround with water feature
1. Guard gates
1. Bollards camou'd as planters

## Guards + access list

Security guard:
1. Provides any necessary physical protection at reception area
1. Validates employees
1. Provides guest access

ID badge:
1. Contact details
1. Worn at all times

Access List:
1. Contains contacts of everyone
1. Enforced by security guard
1. Determines whether person should be in the area

Maintain visitor log:
1. Everyone knows who accessed 'x' facility at what time

## Guards

Two-person integrity:
1. Minimize exposure to attack
1. No 1 person would have access to asset in building
1. Robot sentry:
 1. Monitors via sensors
 1. Periodic scheduled checks
 1. Still emerging tech

## Biometrics

1. Bio authentication:
 1. Fingerprint, retina
1. Math representation of fingerprint
1. Features are hard to change:
 1. Can't change retina
 1. Not easy for attackers to fake
1. Specific situations only, not 100% foolproof

## Door access control

1. Conventional:
 1. Lock and key
1. Deadbolt:
 1. Physical bolt
1. Electronic:
 1. PIN
1. Token-based:
 1. RFID badge, magnetic swipe card, key fob
1. Biometric:
 1. Look above
1. Multifactor:
 1. More than one of above

## Cable lock

1. Temporary security:
 1. Cables plugged in that are securely locked to hardware
1. Standard connector:
 1. Reinforced notch ?
1. Not long term protection, easily cut

## USB data blocker

1. Do not connect to random usb interfaces:
 1. Prevent juice jacking
1. USB data blocker:
 1. Only allow power, not data transfer

## Proper lighting

1. More light is more security:
 1. Attackers avoid light
 1. Easier to detect people when lit
1. Lighting matches requirement for cameras, and guards

## Fencing

1. Building parameter
1. Drawback is they make is obvious youre guarding something
1. Transparent or opaque if needed
1. Difficult to cut
1. Prevent climbing:
 1. Build it high
 1. Razor wires

## Fire suppression

1. Water is bad for electronics, need another medium
1. Detection:
 1. Smoke, flame, heat detectors
1. Use water where appropriate
1. Dupont FM-200 used nowadays, Halon before

## Sensors

1. Motion detection identify movement
1. Noise detection for increase in sound
1. Proximity reader used with door locks
1. Moisture detection to identify water leaks
1. Temperature monitoring machines heat output

## Drones

1. Quickly cover large areas
1. Can be used for surveying sights, and damage assesment
1. Sensors in drones for motion + thermal sensor
1. Video evidence saved in storage

## Faraday cage

1. Blocks electromagnetic fields
1. Mesh of conductive material that cancels electromagnetic field from interior
1. Does not block all signals
1. Restrics communication in and out, so can't call for example

## Screened subnet

1. Is a DMZ
1. Prevent requests from internet access to internal, but access to web server
   and others is allowed. Mail, web, db, more.

## Protected distribution

PDS:
1. Physically secure cable network
1. Wires running in metal conduit
1. Can't break cable and tap data transfer
1. Prevents DoS via cutting cables
1. Periodic audits required to make sure everything is good
