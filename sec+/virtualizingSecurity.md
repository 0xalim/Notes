# Virtualizing Security

VM sprawl avoidance:
1. Because deploying on cloud is easy, need to recover easily too
1. VM's sprawled everything:
 1. Lose track of what vm is for what application
 1. Difficult to deprovision when not needed
1. Formal documentation

VM escape protection:
1. Self-contained vm
1. VM escape:
 1. Can break out of vm and interact with os+hardware
1. Can hop between vm's
1. Full control of everything
