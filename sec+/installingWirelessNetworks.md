# Installing Wireless Networks

## Site Survey

1. Determine existing wireless landscape:
 1. Identify existing access points, you may/may not have control of all
 1. Work around existing frequencies
1. Plan for potential changes later on
1. Heat map: wireless strength in certain areas

## Wireless survey tools

1. Signal coverage (strength of signal)
1. Potential interference of other frequencies
1. Built in tools

## Wireless packet analysis

1. Listen all packets
1. You cannot be the one transmitting, only listening
1. Some networks wont capture wireless information:
 1. Chipset, drivers and more

## Channel selection and overlaps

1. Overlapping channels causes frequency conflicts:
 1. Use non-overlapping channels
1. 2.4Ghz only has channel 1,6,11 for US
1. 5.0Ghz has loads

## Access point placement

1. Minimal overlap
1. Maximize coverage
1. Avoid interference from other:
 1. Third party wireless networks
 1. Building material absorbing signal
 1. Electronic devices
1. Signal strength best when next to device

## Wireless infrastructure security

1. Centralized management for all access points
1. HTTPS between admin browser and device for interface to management
1. Strong encryption required
1. Automatic logout after no activity
1. Strong password + latest firmware
