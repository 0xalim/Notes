NIST definition: Protection from automated information system to preserve the
		 integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information
		 system resources.

Course Objective: 
	* Understand fundamentals of Cyber Security 
	* Practical experience in hardening a system (blue teaming)

Fundamental Topics:
	* Overview (concepts, design principles && attack surfaces)
	* Cryptography
	* Authentication
	* Access control
	* Auditing
	* Databases
	* Malicious software
	* Dos
	* IDS
	* Firewall && prevention
	* Operating system security
	* Law && ethics
	* Cryptographic algorithms
	* System admin


CIA Triad:
	* Confidentiality: Keeping things away from unauthorized users
	* Integrity: Unauthorized modification
	* Availibity: Keeping things up (Dos)

Impact levels:
	* Towards assets, individuals, or the org. itself:
		- Low: Limited effect
		- Moderate: Serious effects
		- High: Catastrophic 

Challenges:
	* Not easy
	* Attacks on security features are possible
	* Additional algorithms are needed
	* 1 weakness is needed from attackers
	* Orgs. often do not see advantage of security until failure
	* Constant monitoring is needed
	* CompSec. is an afterthought of design (which is bad)
	* User-friendly features bottlenecks
