# Software Security - 474

Classroom: TBA
Requisites: 350 / 501
Instructor: Dr. Phu Phung
Telephone: (937) 229 3845
Office Hour: TBA
Grader: TBA

### Description
The course will cover fundamental topics of programming language-based concepts
for computer security. Application-level vulnerabilities and attacks will be 
introduced and explored. The course will cover the design and implementation of
security mechanisms, and software security research in the area of programming
languages and security. Together with lectures, students will learn hands-on
experience through practical labs, programming assignments, and a team project.

### What is language-based security?
Most cyber-attacks today are at the application-level, which cannot be detected
and prevented by conventional computer security mechanisms such as access control
or firewalls. Examples of such attacks include buffer overruns, email worms,
XSS, SQL injections, and so on. To defend against such attacks, the security
countermeasures must be at the application-level. As applications typically 
specified and implemented in the programming languages, this application level
security is the ability to specify fine-grained security policies and to
implement policy enforcement mechanisms using the developed techniques of
programming languages.

### Topics Covered (Tentative)
1. Software security
1. Data races
1. Java security and stack inspection
1. Inlined Reference Monitors (IRMs)
1. Aspect-oriented Programming and IRMs
1. Mobile application security
1. Buffer overflows
1. Database security
1. Web application security
1. OWASP Top 10
 1. Sql injection
 1. Broken authentication
 1. Sensitive Data Exposure
 1. XML External Entities (XEE) 
 1. Broken Access Control
 1. Security Misconfiguration
 1. XSS
 1. Insecure Deserialization
 1. CVE Exploits
 1. Insufficient Logging + Monitoring

### Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand the principle aspects of concepts of software security
1. Indentify and dicuss the types of security threats and attacks at app-level
1. Adopt countermeasures to identified threats and argue their effectivness
1. Apply practical knowledge of security in designing and implementing 
   applications with programming languages like C, Java, PHP and Javascript

### Textbooks
None required. Required readings will be provided. Recommended Book:
[Computer Security: Principles and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Principles-Practice-4th/dp/0134794109)

### Technology Requirements

You are required to have a laptop to run a virtual machine - [Vbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

You will need your laptop/computer for every class. Students are expected to be
familiar with Java and C languages, web programming, and database programming.
Reviews of these backgrounds will be provided.

### Assignments and Grading Policy

Short written quizzes, 2 programming assignments, 6 labs + final:
1. 5% multiple-choice quiz
1. 15% mid-term test
1. 20% final exam
1. 20% programming assignments
1. 25% labs
1. 15% team project
1. 3% bonus credit

Assignments are to explore particular software vulnerabilities and select a
corresponding solution to protect the software. There are two (2) assignments,
which are corresponding to the vulnerabilities of time of check to time of use
(ToCToU), and Web Application security (XSS) and SQL injection.

The project includes a brief project proposal to be approved by the instructor
by the midterm, a project presentation in class in the last week, and a final
project. The project should be also done in pairs.

### Class Protocol + Policy

Multiple choice quiz at most every class, based on covered topics. Discussion
highly emphasized through multiple-choice quiz and will be graded 10% with 
participation (???). Need laptop/phone to answer quiz. Labs will be performed
in clsas and will be submitetd after the class.

Encouraged to participate in every class. Allowed to miss a maximum of 3
classes. Some drop policy I don't really understand. -3% after 3rd absent.
