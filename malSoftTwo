Virus structure:
	* Simple virus:
		- Signature
		- Attach to program
		- Execute payload
		- Trigger conditions
		- Main block 

	* Compression Virus:	(Compresses its host to hide increase of file size)
		- Attach to program
		- Compress file
		- Prepend signature
		- Main block

Virus Classifications:
	* By Target:
		- Boot sector (BIOS), due to vulnerable while booting up
		- File infector, executable by OS
		- Macro virus, little scripts used by applicatiosn (excel scripts)
		- Multipartite virus, uses multiple ways 
	
	* By Concealment:
		- Encrypted virus, little unencrypted part of virus to unencrypt
		  otherwise its hidden to remain stealth
		- Stealth virus, designed to avoid anti-virus
		- Polymorphic virus, mutates after every infection
		- Metamorphic virus, mutates + rewrites itself changing
		  behaviour + appearance (insane concept)

Macro && scripting viruses:
	* Very common due to:
		- Platform independant
		- Infect documents
		- Easily spreadable (sharing of documents)	
		- Exploit MS office applications
	* Due to anti-virus, becoming less of a threat


~~
Worms:
	* Propogates via machine launch padding to infect most # of systems
	* Exploits software vulners in client + server programs
	* Uses network connections to propogate
	* Can spread through USB && other DVD CD stuff
	* Email + macro / script code included in attachments
	* Usually has payload (not always)
	* Xerox palo alto labs first seen (no paylaod, just used for pinging)

Worm replication:
	* Copies itself to other systems via attachments on instant messaging 
	* Infects file as a virus on removable media
	* Can execute itself on another system
	* Remote file access / transfer capable
	* Log into other systems and replicates itself

Worm target discovery:
	* Scanning (fingerprinting):
		- Random, hits every IP address space (very loud obv).
		- Hit-list, attacker has compiled long list of potential
		  vulnerable machines
		- Topological, uses infected machine to find other hosts
		- Local subnet, ?? not sure

Worm Propagation Model:
	* Slow start, little amount of infected targets
	* Fast spread, critical speed of infection
	* Slow finish, not many machines left to infect

Morris Worm:
	* Earliest malicious worm (that had big impact)
	* By Robert Morris (1988)
	* Designed for UNIX systems
		- Cracks local password file for username/passwd 
		- Exploited bug in finger protocol that basically pings remote user
		- Exploited trapdoor (backdoor) that receives / sends mail
		- Lost control of propogation (too fast)
	* Infected attacks had coms with OS command interpreter
	* Morris convicted of violating Computer Fruad and Abuse act. (Fuck this <-)

Some recent attacks:
	* SQL slammer, exploited buffer overflow in SQL server
	* Mydoom, mass emailer that installed backdoor in machines
	* Stuxnet, restricted spread to reduce detection to industrial control sys.
	* Miria (2016), targets IoT systems having infected 600K devices.
	  used all that computing power to perform DDOS attcks.

Worm Tech:
	* Multi platform, very good upside
	* multi-exploit, can do lots of things
	* Ultra fast spreader, due to network spreading capabilities
	* Polymorphic, can mutate
	* Metamorphic, can mutate + rewrite itself to change behaviour + appearance


~~
Mobile code:
	* Platform independant
	* Transmited from remote to local sys's to execute local payloads
	* Mechanism for worms, virus && trojan horse
	* Popular vehicles:
		- Java applets
		- ActiveX
		- JavaScript
		- VBScript


~~
Mobile Phone worms:
	* First discovered was Cabir in 2004
	* Laso and CommWarrior in 2005
	* Communicates through bluetooth or multimedia messaging services
	* Targets are smartphones
	* Can dsiable phone, delete data, force costly messages
	
Drive-by-downloads:
	* Exploits browser vulners to install malware on system
	  via user browsing the webpage, doesn't need to install anything
	* Most cases, does not actively propogate

Clickjacking:
	* User interface redress attack
	* Basically a frame is installed ontop or behind ACTUAL fields
	* Password/usernames can be stolen via these malicious frames
	* Clicks can have invis frames behind them to download malicious software
	* Takes advantage of Adobe flash && Javascript\
	* Can be seen as highjacking clicks <- thus the name clickjacking


~~
Social Engineering: (wtf is this shit powerpoint?)
	* Tricking users to assist in compromise of own systems
	* Spam:
		- Bulk spam emails
		- Carries lots of malware
		- Phishing attacks

	* Trojan horse:
		- Program that contains harmful code
		- Attacker accomplishes tasks usually not possible directly

	* Mobile phone trojans:
		- Target is smarphone

Payload:
	* Chernobyl Virus:
		- 1998 first seen
		- Windows 95 and 98 virus
		- Infects executables && entire file system when date is reaches
		  date being the logic bomb

	* Klez:
		- Mass emailer infecting XP to 95 systems
		- Trigger date causes files on hard drive to become empty
	
	* Ransomeware:
		- Encrypts users files and demands payment (usually crypto)
		  even though sometimes payments do not mean files will become
		  unencrypted via giving the payer the key
		- PC Cyborg Trojan
		- WannaCry

Payload System corruption:
	* Capable of causing real world damage
		- Chernobyl virus rewrites BIOS code
		- Stuxnet targets industrial control systems
		  people worrying about use of malware in industrial sabotage
		- Logic bomb: code embedded in malware thats set to 'explode'
		  upon certain conditions
