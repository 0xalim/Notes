# XSS

**cross site scripting**
mixing of data + code

* Malicious searching:
1. entering script tags into parameter values for url's
1. similar to LFI:

```
// Normal search
example.com/?search=flower

// Malicious searching
example.com/?search=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

// Can even url encode
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

Attack vectors:
1. email random people with link like above to execute code for you
1. good for mobile / url shortners where you don't see the full link

Method of prevention (one of):

* Import htmlEscape and use it for any user input that needs sanitisation
```
const htmlEscape = ('html-escape')
const source = htmlEscape(req.query.source)
```
Why is it so popular?
1. web has many langauges
1. many ways to escape
1. many complicated rules to web context and languages


### Reflected XSS

* malicious code placed in http request itself
* goal: find url that can take your malicious input
* limits: code must be in the url/parameters

### Stored XSS

* code persists in the database
* server includes code to other clients
* essentially the code comes from the server to others, due to your input

### Javascript + Data

in a new browser can do something like this:
```
javascript:<script>alert(1)</script>
```
```
data:text/html, <html contenteditable></html>
```

both these commands will run if input in a browser

### Other Attacks:

1. exit code via **'** or **"**
1. exit code with *</script>* and then input your own *<script>*
1. comment out code with **--**
1. some characters are also ending sequences e.g: @!#$%^^&

### Other preventions:

1. hex encode user input
1. use escape sequence on **'** and **"** and **/**
 1. but this is just fixing the sympton not the issue
1. replace characters above with entities (e.g **"**: &apos)
1. use *<template>* tag

### Robustness principle

*be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept*
not necessarily good as bugs in one platform need to be carried out in other
platforms due to it needing to work one way. need to tell users what to fix in
their input rather than accepting the input.
