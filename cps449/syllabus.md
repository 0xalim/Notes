Prereq: CPS 350
Teaching Assistant: By Appointment

### Course Description
Introduction to cloud computing concepts + hands on experience on cloud services.
(Azure, google cloud shell). Cloud based application development and deployment. 
Includes team projects (sprints) and individual work (assigments). Front+back end.

Topics:
1. Fundamentals of cloud computing and applications
1. Fundamentals of HTTP Protocol
1. Web application development:
 1. Client-side: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
 1. Server-side: Node.js (yikes)
1. Async. and realtime applications with Ajax+WebSocket
1. Cloud-based database management and programming (mongoDB)
1. Full stack web development
1. Application deployment to the cloud

### Goals
1. Establish strong background in web development environments
1. Establish sustainable development principles + discipline for web+cloud apps
1. Establish logical mindset about data synch between client and server
1. Gaining cloud computing knowledge
1. Establish mindset of automation during release

### Hand-on experiences
Course based on labs, a large programming assignment and multiple team projects.
Labs will be hands-on and guided in the class+videos. Assignment is an extended work
related to the labs, and will hopefully help students udnerstand the concepts as to
apply it in the real world. Team projects are done in pairs (2-peopled) to have a 
sense of agile software development while taking labs. A full system will have been
built by the third sprint.

### Tentative labs
1. Environment setup, including: azure, cloud shell + bitbucket (github for me)
1. Web server on cloud, http traffic, and simple web application
1. Web application development and deployment on the cloud
1. Full stack development; integrating node.js with mongoDB
1. Real-time web application; simple web chat system
1. (Optional) Cloud deployment with docker 

### Textbook
**No required reading/txtbook**. Lecture handouts are provided. 
**Recommended Reading:**
Essentials of cloud computing, K. Chandrasekaran, CRC Press, 2015 [Free online]

### Shell + git
Shell and git are not taught for some reason in CS courses; thus we need to allow 
students to learn them on their free time cause our schedule is absolute trash:

[MIT 'The Missing Semester of Yoru CS Education'](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course/shell)

[Google Cloud Shell](ssh.cloud.google.com)

[Using git](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control)
Imagine not teaching git to cs students... tf?

### Assessments and Grading Policy
1. Lab: 35
1. Programming assignment: 20
1. Quizzes: 15
1. Final essay: 10
1. team project: 20
