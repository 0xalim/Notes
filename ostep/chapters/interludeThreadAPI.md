# Interlude: Thread API

This chapter *briefly* discusses main portions of thread API. Better used as
a reference manual of sorts instead of properly reading and learning as if
it were a normal chapter. Includes lots of coding and how to create threads
in a `POSIX` compliant manner.

*Crux: What interfaces should os give for creation+control? How should the
interfaces be designed for better control+utility?*
