Malware: Program injected onto target covertly; to harm CIA of data, applications,
	 or OS. Or to annoy / disrupt the victim.

Classes of Malware:
	* Based on how it spreads / propogates (worms / viruses)
	* Actions / payloads it performs on victim (trojans / bots)

Propogation:
	* Virus that spread to other systems 
	* Exploit of software vulners by worms to replicate itself
	* Social engineering attacks to bypass security

Payload actions:
	* Corrupt system data / files
	* Addition to botnet (zombify)
	* Key logging
	* Stealthing for passive recon

Toolkits: 'crimeware' basically packages that get deployed onto a system that
	  contains a bundle of mechanics / paylods modules that can be deployed
	  developed 90's and early 00's.
		- Zeus:
			Trojan horse malware runs on windows; steals bank info
			through man in the browser keylogging. Also
			has ransomware. Spread through drive-by-downloads && phishing.
			Tricks users into providing customer support for money. 
			Mastermind was Bx1; arrested by FBI in thailand. Many other
			people used it to transfer money from bank account through 
			mules to outside of the US. 
		- Blackhole:
			Appeared on Malwox (underground russian webforum). Created
			by HodLum and Paunch. Delivers payload to victims system.
		- Sakura
		- Pheonix

Attack Sources: Changed from inidivual developers to:
	* Politically backed attackers
	* outtsider && insider
	* Criminals
	* Organized crime
	* Orgs that sell to companies && nations
	* National government agencies

-> thus giving rise to motivation to the further development of better malware
and an underground economy that is involved in the sale of attack kits, compromised
hosts and stolen information


Advanced Persistent Threat: Groups of hackers and attackers that deploy malware 
for theft of data or other resources from their target (which are business or political)
They are state sponsored orgs / criminal enterprises. Differ from other types of attaks
due to their stealthy efforts and persistance over a long period of time. Profiles:
	- Aurora: Operation aurora backed by Elderwood ties with peoples liberation
		  army. China. Modification of source code at high tech companies,
		  security and defense contractors.
	- RSA: Stole info from RSA security form on particular product for 2FA. 
	- APT1: Chinese cyber espionage unit
	- Stuxnet: Targeted Iranian SCADA systems via PLC's. Building of weapon for war


APT characteristics:
	* Aim:
		- Theft of property / security && infrastructure
		- Physical disruption of infrastructure
	* Technique:
		- Social engineering
		- Spear phishing
		- Drive by downloads from phishing links
	* Intent:
		- Infection of system with malware that propogates && executes payloads
		- Continue keeping access to the target via backdoors

~~
Virus:
	* Modifies programs to replicate itself and spread throughout more networks
	* Has same privilage level as executable program
	* Specific to operating systems and hardware

Virus components:
	* Infection mechanism: 
		- Replicates / propogates
	* Trigger:
		- What makes the payload activate
	* Payload:
		- Damage / activity


Virus phases:
	* Dormant 
	* Trigger
	* Propogation
	* Execution
