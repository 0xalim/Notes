# My Notes

These are my notes from personal courses, so think online courses and such.
No specified goal really, just sort of a vault to keep everything neat and
tidy similar to what you would like to see your desk and drawers to look like.

* Operating System: Three Easy Steps (OSTEP)
* Security+ (CERT)
* Research (WebGuard)
* CTF
* Ben [?]
